    Controller Component 
    Buttons Component

    Button Presses Component

Populate a container with a controller for each connected

How do I want to handle multiple controllers being plugged in?

Require Button Press, something like "If you have a controller connected press a button"

- Break into separate files
- Lift state up into parent
- Turn components into functional components where possible
- PWA
- Cool CSS animations
- MaterialUI
